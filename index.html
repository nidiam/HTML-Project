 <p class="Paragraph">
   I have two dogs. One is a Siberian Husky/Shepherd mix and the other is a Shihtzu. Both are complete opposites of each other, which is really funny! Cleo is energetic and clingy, Bubba is relaxed and independent. Bubba is my cuddling dog and Cleo is my active dog. It's nice to have the best of both worlds! 
 </p>

 <p class="Facts">
   Fun Facts: Shih tzus were often at the foot of the Emperors in China so they are great lap dogs! Husky and German Shepherd mixes are called Gerberian Shepskys and they need at least 120 minutes of activity per day!
